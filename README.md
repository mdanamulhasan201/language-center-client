*  Key Features:
✔  Authentication: The implementation of Firebase authentication guarantees a secure and dependable platform for all users, ensuring their safety and privacy.
✔ Role-Based Access: The system grants distinct responsibilities and permissions to students, instructors, and administrators, facilitating effective supervision and administration of the learning process.
✔ Students: Students can effortlessly create an account and select their desired courses. If a student wishes to drop or remove a chosen class, they can easily do so through the system's interface. To ensure a secure payment process, the system integrates with reliable payment gateways, providing students with a seamless and protected transaction experience. Once the payment is completed, students gain immediate access to the course materials and resources, allowing them to begin their learning journey without any delays or complications.
✔ Secure Payments System: This site leverages the Stripe payment system, allowing for seamless and secure payment processing.
✔ Instructors: Instructors have the convenience of creating, uploading, and updating courses with ease. However, the content needs to go through an approval process by administrators before it becomes accessible to others.
✅ The user-friendly interface of the system, characterized by a clean and modern design, enhances navigation and engagement. Additionally, the system ensures secure routing through the use of JWT (JSON Web Tokens).To further enhance the user experience, the system incorporates various interactive libraries such as React Hook Form, SweetAlert2, React Toast, React-Carousel, and Swiper. These libraries add interactivity and dynamism to the user interface, resulting in an elevated user experience.
